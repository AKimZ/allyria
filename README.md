A text-based RPG for the masochistic and easily amused.

Dungeon-game.rb will open the actual game in terminal.

I still have the following to do:

+ Allow the player to enter shorthand directions ("n" for "north" "nw" for "northwest" etc.)
+ Puts an error message if the player enters a direction not allowed
+ if block for gender of the dragon (????)
+ switch trapped so that it puts the rat ASCII
+ more items
+ dragon moves around...time dependent
+ pick up food. You can only feed the dragon if you have food.
+ breakup the while loop into smaller functions
+ room sub-classes...dragonroom, traproom, etc.
+ room instance variables instead of trapped etc.
+ Class for user IO
+ reject (array/hash) instead of using the trapped etc. variables.
